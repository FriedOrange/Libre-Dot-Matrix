<p>Matrix Sans is based on the classic 5-by-7 dot matrix fonts that originated in the 20th century with punched card machines, dot-matrix printers, light-up signs at stadiums, etc. and early computers and video equipment. Such fonts still surround us in the 21st centuryâ€”for example: in LED displays of car radios and microwave ovens; VFDs in hi-fi and audiovisual equipment; electronic road signs and train stations displays; flip-dot displays in buses and airports; LCDs in calculators and the "character LCD" modules found in all kinds of electronic equipment; and dot-matrix printers, which are still used to some extent, particularly for the expiry dates printed on food packaging.</p>
	
<p>Nowadays, "pixel" style fonts like this are very popular, particularly as they evoke nostalgia for retro computers and video games. Most currently available free (and even commercial) fonts in this style are lacking in refinement and glyph coverage, though. Matrix Sans was conceived in 2019 to satisfy the need for a free, versatile and high-quality dot-matrix style font. Dozens of existing designs were studied in preparation; the goal for this project was to balance consistency and sound design with quirkiness and authenticity to its historic sources.</p>

<p>Matrix Sans was created by drawing the glyphs as bitmaps, then turning them into outlines in FontForge with the help of a custom Python script. This method made it trivial to provide multiple variants with different styles of dots, allowing for faithful renditions of the various real-world examples of dot-matrix fonts. While its forebears are strictly utilitarian and technologically restricted, Matrix Sans is intended to be a useful, modern, display font; inspired by other retro-revival typefaces like the popular American Typewriter, it eschews its monospaced heritage in favour of proportional spacing and kerning.</p>

<p>On screen, it looks best at multiples of 15-point size, where its outlines exactly align with screen pixels. The font is deliberately unhinted, to prevent its "dots" from appearing uneven at other sizes.</p>
